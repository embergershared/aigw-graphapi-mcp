# Security and private access

The starter is private by default in the `private` and `full` profiles: VM NICs
have no public IP, Storage and Key Vault public network access is disabled,
shared-key Storage access and local Application Insights authentication are
disabled, and workload access uses managed identity/Entra RBAC.

Profile affects the surface. Read this page alongside the profile you are
deploying:

| Profile | Security posture |
|---|---|
| `core` | No network is created, so there is no private DNS and no private endpoint. Any catalog module you add deploys public-with-firewall. Managed identity, Entra RBAC, disabled shared keys and disabled local authentication still apply. |
| `private` | Private endpoints and VNet-linked private DNS for every module that supports Private Link; public network access disabled on those services. |
| `full` | Everything in `private`, plus the brokered administration path and the approved public exceptions below. |

Adding a data service to a `core` project is a deliberate trade-off: without a
VNet, the service is reachable from the internet subject to its own firewall and
Entra authorization. If the data is sensitive, use `private` instead of relying
on a service firewall alone.

## Approved public exceptions

| Exception | Why | Guardrail |
|---|---|---|
| Standard Bastion public IP in `full` | Brokered administration | HTTPS to Bastion only; RDP/SSH reaches VMs only from the Bastion subnet |
| NAT public IP in `full` | Entra VM extension/bootstrap egress | Jumpbox subnet association only; outbound-only |
| Azure Monitor public ingestion/query | Keep Log Analytics and Application Insights usable without private link | Local authentication disabled; Entra authorization and resource-scoped access remain required |
| Public-with-firewall services in `core` | The profile deploys no VNet to put an endpoint in | Service firewall plus Entra RBAC; no shared keys; step up to `private` when that is not enough |

Any additional public endpoint, firewall bypass, or broad NSG rule requires a
documented security decision and validation. Azure Monitor public access is an
intentional exception and organizational policy may reject it.

## Private DNS

In the `private` and `full` profiles the VNet links one non-registering zone per
Private Link endpoint declared in the [module catalog](modules.md), currently:

- `privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net`
- `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`
- `privatelink.file.core.windows.net`

The zone list is generated from module metadata into
`infra/core/private-dns-zones.json`, so adding a module with a private endpoint
adds and links its zone automatically. Review the resulting zone before
deploying it into a network with existing DNS.

Clients must resolve service FQDNs through the VNet-linked zones to private
endpoint addresses. For custom/on-premises DNS, use conditional forwarding
through Azure DNS Private Resolver or an Azure DNS forwarder. Do not forward
directly to a private endpoint IP or create duplicate/conflicting zones. Test
with `Resolve-DnsName`/`nslookup` from the jumpbox or another VNet-connected
client. See [Azure private endpoint DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-dns).

## Azure Monitor access

Log Analytics and workspace-based Application Insights explicitly enable public
ingestion and query. Application Insights local authentication remains
disabled, so clients must use Microsoft Entra authentication rather than
instrumentation-key authentication. Keep Azure RBAC least-privileged and review
the public monitoring exception against subscription policy before deployment.

## Entra primary and break glass (`full` profile only)

Entra VM login is the primary administrative path. The template creates local
usernames and generated passwords only for emergency recovery, stores them as
secrets in the template-created private Key Vault, and grants configured
operators **Key Vault Secrets User**.

Key Vault is RBAC-enabled, purge-protected, public-disabled, and
`enabledForTemplateDeployment`. That last setting lets the ARM/Bicep deployment
retrieve secure secret values for VM provisioning; it does not make the vault
public or expose secrets as outputs.

Purge protection is on unless `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_PURGE_PROTECTION` is `false`.
Only the throwaway [pull request deployments](ci-deployment.md) turn it off,
because their teardown must purge the vault so its name is free again. Never
turn it off for an environment that holds secrets you need to keep.

The passwords use Bicep-generated secure defaults. **Reprovisioning generates
and stores new values**, and VMAccess extensions reset the guest accounts to
the same values before the deployment succeeds. Previously retrieved values
must therefore be treated as expired. Always retrieve the current secret from
a VNet-connected client and never print, log, copy into tickets, or commit it.
Portal secret reads from an internet-only workstation fail by design because
the vault data plane is private.

In full profile, NAT is required for Entra extensions and login bootstrap. An
air-gapped override must set both `natGateway=false` and `entraLogin=false`;
this deliberately removes Entra as the primary login path and requires an
approved break-glass and patching plan before deployment.
